Pickering, ThM PhD, ©, being based on his edition of the Greek New Testament, according to the only significant line of transmission, both ancient and independent, that has a demonstrable archetypal form in all 27 books. The Greek Text of which this is a translation, and articles explaining the preference, may be downloaded free from  www.prunch.org.","24007234442979097":"Whose, the Father’s or the Son’s? Probably the Son’s, but in practice it makes little or no difference. Yes, the Text says “slaves”, so this book is not intended for the merely curious.","5732665969990194":"The Text actually says, “with speed”. Since to God 1000 years = one day, it has only been two days!","8978051545564085":"Any testimony of Jesus Christ is a word of God.","43096244405023754":"Most, if not all, versions have ‘he saw’ (referring to John, not Jesus) and omit the rest of the verse. The manuscript evidence is seriously divided at this point. My translation reflects two of the three main independent lines of transmission, including the best one (as I see it). See 22:20, “He who testifies to these things says, ‘Yes, I am coming swiftly!’ Oh yes!! Come Lord Jesus!” The whole book is what Jesus Christ is testifying, is revealing; as an eye witness. So the whole book is inspired.","3472480713389814":"John is evidently claiming divine inspiration for what he is writing. You won’t be blessed for reading or hearing a newspaper or a magazine. Notice that one person is reading (aloud) and a number of people are hearing, which was the norm in the congregations, since very few could afford to have a private copy of Scripture. Notice further that it is necessary to “keep” what is written.","9326308635063469":"The sequence “from..., and from..., and from...” suggests three persons. The third, “Jesus Christ”, has to be the Son. “The seven-fold Spirit” would be the Holy Spirit. So “Him who is, was and is coming” must be the Father. Just over half of the Greek MSS add ‘God’ after the first “from” to make the connection overt (but the best line of transmission does not).","1834163547027856":"Although the evidence is badly divided, I take it that the original reading is “the seven spirits which is”. A plural subject with a singular verb is anomalous, unless we understand “seven-fold Spirit which is”. If the Deity is three in one, why might not the Holy Spirit be seven in one? See Isaiah 11:2.","15049913595430553":"When and how was He “the faithful witness”? Throughout His life on earth He was the faithful witness to the Father’s character, what the Father was doing (John 5:19), what the Father was saying (John 12:50). Here He is the faithful witness to what is going to happen.","519250379409641":"We have two readings here: one is clearly “from among the dead” while the other is ambiguous, meaning either “from among the dead” or ‘of the dead’. With the latter option, “firstborn” could have the derived meaning of ‘lord’ or ‘boss’. I take it that the better option is to follow the best line of transmission and read “from among”, in which case “firstborn” has its primary meaning. Death is pictured as a huge womb, pregnant with all the dead, and Jesus Christ was the first one out, literally the “firstborn”—but only the first! Because Jesus conquered death, we too may emerge from that ‘womb’. Thank you Lord!","9626417334657162":"Satan has been demoted—see John 12:31.","3838474974036217":"What was the function of a priest? A priest was a go-between, representing the people to God. I would say that intercessory prayer is a priestly function.","8069838774390519":"The soldier who actually pierced His side on the cross, and the religious leaders who brought the situation about, are presumably in Hades. I take it that we are being told that the dead will also see Him when He returns to reign. The human spirit is indestructible, so those in Hades are very much ‘aware’ (Luke 16:22-31).","888620134210214":"That is how people used to talk—you may prefer ‘Yes, indeed!’ or ‘Even so, amen!’ The certainty that all tribes will beat their breasts is being emphasized.","8754527906421572":"To be the first and the last you have to be the biggest, all the time.","47283455333672464":"In verse 8 the Father speaks, putting His weight behind what is being written.","2593196553643793":"“The tribulation and kingdom and endurance”—that there is only one definite article for the three nouns presumably indicates that the three are regarded as a single package. To participate in the Kingdom in this life involves tribulation and requires endurance.","4508359089959413":"Presumably the witness that John gave about Jesus Christ. As in this verse, the human authors frequently alternated ‘Jesus Christ’ and ‘Christ Jesus’—so far as I can see, it was merely a stylistic devise to reduce repetition.","37258716369979084":"There is no definite article with “spirit”, so to capitalize the word is arbitrary. It could refer to the Holy Spirit, but I think it more likely that it refers to John’s spiritual condition (see 4:2 below).","6305975241120905":"It was at that point that he turned.","5449380541685969":"The Lord Jesus referred to Himself as “the Son of the Man”, always with the two definite articles, but here there are no articles (in the Greek). John saw a human like form, very different from the Jesus he had known.","39000502577982843":"Since the figure was clothed, the nipples would not be visible, so the point is presumably to give the position of the belt—across the middle of the chest. Since no further mention is made of the belt, in the letters, it is hard to know what purpose it served. But see 15:6 below.","8389168598223478":"A low (or loud) roar that pervades the atmosphere—it is awesome, and you can’t get away from it.","7080281069502234":"Comparing this with verse 14 it is evident that only the part of the head covered by the hair was white, the face (probably no beard) was like the sun.","8867728549521416":"But He had seven stars on that hand! Presumably the stars were on His open hand, so He rested the back of His hand on John. Since the seven stars represented the messengers of the seven churches, what might the symbolism be? Since the seven churches, taken together, represent the total Church (presumably), perhaps the glorified Christ is blessing John on behalf of the Church, so that he will be a blessing to that Church, in his turn.","5591992947738618":"Oh praise God! Satan used to have the keys, Hebrews 2:14, but now Jesus has them, because He did indeed vanquish the devil.","4187991109210998":"In verse 8 the Father guarantees the veracity of the prophecy; here the Son, who conquered death and lives forevermore, does the guaranteeing.","9866660293191671":"I take it that the precise form of the original Text here has the effect of affirming the certainty of the coming events. This verse is often taken as giving the outline of the book: “what you saw” = chapter 1; “things that are” = chapters 2-3; “things to come” = chapters 4-22.","6638633778784424":"The Greek word  may mean messenger or angel (they are often messengers). Since 2:20 below says “your wife”, referring to the messenger, we should presumably understand ‘messenger’ here as referring to a man. It is possible that messengers from these churches were visiting John, on Patmos, or had visited him earlier.","4667042412329465":"These letters have received a variety of ‘interpretations’. The basic meaning is obviously the literal one—these were actual churches at the time that John wrote, and each one was exactly as described in its letter. By way of application, these churches may also be taken as symbolic—at any given moment throughout the history of the Church local churches may be found to be similar in character to any one of these seven. It is also possible to see these seven churches as prophetic of the general course of the Church through time, and in that event we are presumably in the last or Laodicean age.","604483179980889":"Christ’s walking about in the midst of the churches is not an aimless meandering; He is observing and evaluating.","8474136868026108":"Evidently it is possible to test the validity of someone’s claim to be an apostle—I wish we had been told how to do it.","006622670451179147":"Ouch!","6334773337002844":"They had not taken a sudden fall, they had drifted from their moorings, a process so gradual that it may go unnoticed for quite some time. It can happen to us too.","44118282315321267":"In fact, Ephesus did lose its lampstand.","6022288764361292":"We do not know for sure who or what they were. The etymology of the word suggests ‘laity conquerors’, perhaps the beginning of the system where the clergy dominates the laity. Once someone has a ‘guaranteed’ position their lifestyle often becomes licentious.","12323435978032649":"That is right, just one ear. In other words, we had better pay attention!","0022365821059793234":"At this point it becomes very clear that God is giving a general application to these letters. The first one was written to a literal church in literal Ephesus, in literal terms, but  all  of us are to pay attention to the spiritual principles and lessons involved.","20083842636086047":"So what happens if you don’t overcome??","07697806297801435":"The Tree of Life is first mentioned in Genesis 3:22-24; it must have been transplanted out of the Garden of Eden before the Flood, unless it was a replica of the original in God’s Paradise. A considerable majority of the Greek manuscripts, including the best line of transmission, have “my” God. While walking this earth the Son repeatedly referred to the Father as ‘my God’.","7401981458533555":"Here, and in 1:17 and 22:13, the glorified Christ calls Himself “the First and the Last”—comparing with Isaiah 44:6 we have one of several demonstrations that Jesus Christ is Jehovah [Mormons and JWs deny that He is Jehovah].","6216046179179102":"You had better believe that there is a ‘synagogue of Satan’ near you! Why do you suppose that 1 Peter 5:8 says to “ be vigilant ”? In our day false Christians are more of a problem than false Jews.","6027731420472264":"The Lord does not promise us a free ride, bed of roses, or whatever. Here they are given specific advance warning—bad times ahead. (Presumably the “days” are not solar.)","0770460176281631":"So what happens if you don’t stay faithful? Note that the Lord does not register any complaint against Smyrna. If you are being persecuted for your faith it tends to keep you pretty close to the Lord. Also there is no incentive to pretend.","22635326138697565":"Revelation 20:14 makes clear that “the second death” is the Lake of Fire. The first death is the physical one; the second is the spiritual one—eternal separation from the Creator, in whose image we are. Of course the redeemed go into eternal life, not death, so the “second death” holds no threat for them. But there is the little matter of ‘overcoming’.","09145767777226865":"I find the double reference to Satan here to be curious. The opposition in the spirit realm would be especially strong.","832275214837864":"Why are fornication and adultery becoming more and more common in ‘Christian’ circles today? They come with idolatry—the church is riddled with humanism, relativism, materialism, spiritism, etc., false gods all. One wonders how many Christians today have a worldview that is strictly Biblical, without any admixture of the world’s values.","6753316866233945":"Birds of a feather flock together; if you start sinning in one area, before long it is two.","31142022903077304":"Notice that the pronoun changes—it is specifically against the Nicolaitans and Balaamites that He will fight.","027569340309128165":"“From” is literal, maybe too literal; perhaps we should render “some of” the hidden manna.","9451205562800169":"Our name identifies us to other people, so what good is a name that no one knows? Except that the giver knows, obviously. So maybe the private name has to do with a private relationship, between giver and receiver! Eating “hidden manna” also sounds sort of private.","41543768206611276":"If anyone was still in doubt as to the identity of the One who is dictating these letters, the doubt stops here.","5673351320438087":"Each of the seven letters begins with this phrase, ‘I know your works’. How we act reflects our world-view, what we really believe.","9259466908406466":"Wow, here is a church that has it all—love, faith, service, endurance—and it is growing, doing more and more! Yes, well, but, then there is the rest of the story.","743173613678664":"About three fourths of the Greek manuscripts, including the best line of transmission, read “your wife” rather than ‘that woman’. The main group that reads ‘that woman’ reflects a tradition that is full of obvious corruptions, and so does not inspire confidence. The original reading is doubtless “your wife”. To have a wife the messenger must be a man, not an angel.","5027782362885773":"The Lord uses an emphatic possessive pronoun here—she is messing with  His  slaves.","2755630479659885":"Again, notice that fornication and idolatry go together.","457572482759133":"If someone refuses to repent they are beyond help; judgment has to come.","9783036168664694":"Two thirds of the Greek manuscripts, including the most dependable group, have “her” works, not ‘their’ works. In verse 20 the Lord emphasized that they were His slaves. If the original reading is “her” works, as I believe, then what is involved here is spiritual adultery—she was not literally sleeping with a variety of men in the church. No matter how much love, faith and service there may be in a church, the Lord will not tolerate idolatry, which is spiritual adultery.","9109783619642258":"Literally ‘kill by death’—so how else can you kill someone if not by death? Those who are familiar with the KJV will recall the phrase ‘let him die the death’, which in the context implies execution. I take it that “her children” does not refer to her literal sons and daughters, but to her ‘spiritual children’, those who have bought into her teaching and life style. The Lord wants to eradicate her ‘genes’, as it were. But why does God not kill Jezebel herself, instead of her children? I imagine that God uses evil people, like Jezebel, to put the rest of us to the test, to see whose side we really are on. Those who go along with a ‘Jezebel’ do not really want God.","9674719590693712":"What we do, or do not do, not only makes a difference down here, but will also make a difference ‘up there’.","7033758200705051":"“Known” implies experiential knowledge. Note that the Lord links Jezebel’s teaching directly to Satan, and those who are doing it are deeply involved with him (whether or not they fully understand the implications—if they are ‘deceived’ [v. 20] then they may indeed not understand).","011766049545258284":"They were doing quite well, generally—see the second note with verse 19 above. So if they throw off Jezebel’s influence they will be all right.","3079315696377307":"“Keeps my works until the end”—it is not enough to hold to the right doctrine; the Lord wants to see us reproducing His works (John 14:12). Notice that our participation in the administration of the Millennial Messianic Kingdom is at stake.","8434481860604137":"The Lord is evidently referring to Psalms 2:7-9. In that event He is declaring that He is the “Son” in verse7 and that He did indeed ask for and receive the nations as an inheritance. If we are co-heirs (Romans 8:17) then we are involved in the outworking.","3948884829878807":"In Revelation 22:16 the Lord declares Himself to be the “morning star”. In Isaiah 14:12 Satan is called “day- star, son of the morning”, but that was what he was before he fell. The planets Venus and Mercury are the ‘morning stars’ we see in the sky at dawn. But the Lord here says the morning star. I guess we will find out what He means when we get there.","9581503982190043":"In 1:4 above “the seven Spirits“, which I rendered as “seven-fold Spirit”, has to do with the Holy Spirit. Here I think not—the Lord ‘has’ them like He has the seven stars. Perhaps the reference is to Isaiah 11:2.","46554514998570085":"“That you were about to throw away” is the reading of about 2/3 of the Greek manuscripts, including the most dependable group, as opposed to ‘that were about to die’. They had probably already stopped believing in a variety of Biblical truths and were on the verge of dumping the rest, like the theological modernist or liberal of our day. Not surprisingly, they were short on works as well.","7766319124493748":"See Luke 8:18.","7054329598322511":"The Text is very clear—the glorified Christ said “erase”. You cannot erase something that is not there! To argue that Christ is using an impossibility as a threat is to accuse Him of using language deceitfully, a form of lying— not smart! By the grace of God my name is in the Book of Life, but what happens if I don’t overcome? In all seven letters our risen Lord places heavy emphasis upon our human responsibility. God will take care of His side; we had better take a careful look at our side.","09991706418804824":"Comparing this statement with Jesus’ statement in Matthew 10:32-33, confessing is the opposite of denying. Since eternal destiny is at stake, the confessing/denying must involve what we are and do, not just our words. Confessing has to do with overcoming.","6534366835840046":"The evidence is badly divided with reference to the wording of the last half of the verse. The translation given here reflects over half of the Greek manuscripts, including the most dependable group. We are accustomed to the more balanced form, but the basic point remains the same.","3185424793045968":"I take it that this will happen here on earth—a pleasant prospect! Since they have been slandering us (at the very least, 2:9) this will be a welcome vindication. I imagine that at this point in history the “synagogue of Satan” includes people who claim to be Christians, but are not really. They may even be in positions of leadership (cf. Jeremiah 20:1-4).","22557880985550582":"There has always been tribulation and testing here and there on the earth, but to include “the whole inhabited earth” the reference must be to the Great Tribulation. How can you be “kept from the hour” if you are in the middle of it? To be protected in the middle of a situation is not the same as being kept from it. This text would appear to point toward a pre-tribulation, or pre-wrath, rapture of the Church.","12697912962175906":"Would the glorified Christ make an empty threat? So how does someone take our crown? How about if someone moves into a spot that you relinquished?","3020219143945724":"That is three names.","4052668586373329":"If the Lord vomits you out, where do you go? Something can only be vomited out if it is in.","8880600410047919":"Sounds like ‘tough’ love. The Greek word is  , not  . See Hebrews 12:6.","5856427359394729":"Although this text is widely used in evangelism, it is actually directed to Christians. The Lord is offering fellowship and communion to those who claim to belong to Him. Recall that the Father seeks those who will worship Him in spirit and truth (John 4:23). Many have the impression that God is hard to find or reach, but He disagrees: “You will seek me and find me, when you search for me with all your heart” (Jeremiah 29:13). The trouble is that few of us are willing to meet the condition. See also 2 Chronicles 15:2 and 16:9; also Acts 17:27.","19511459744535387":"Evidently He both knocks and calls. In many cultures one calls out rather than knocks [there may not be any door, or the dogs may not let you get near it], and in the Apurinã culture (an indigenous people in the Amazon jungle, among whom I lived for several years) you call the person’s name.","06900023692287505":"“Consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself, . . .” (Hebrews 12:3; see also verses 4- 11). He overcame, we must overcome—God is not offering a free ride.","8529743941035122":"Comparing this statement with Ephesians 1:19-21 and 2:6, what is the picture? Since the Son is now literally “seated” at the Father’s right hand, this promise should be taken literally. But how about right now? I take it that we are supposed to be conducting ourselves on the basis of our position in Christ, on the basis of His victory and authority—maybe this has something to do with ‘overcoming’.","0015127561055123806":"This is a reference to 1:10 above, so it is the glorified Christ who is speaking—He is continuing His communicating (see 1:1), only now He is speaking from Heaven.","4711513100191951":"“After these” opens and closes the verse. ‘These’ is a pronoun, so what is its antecedent? Presumably the churches described in chapters 2 and 3 (“the things that are” referred to in 1:19). Does “after” the churches imply that they are off the scene?","7561327449511737":"Compare 1:10. The Voice commanded him to “come up here”—it was something John had to do; I take it that his spirit was transported to heaven.

Surely it is more likely that ‘nine’ would be changed to ‘three’ than vice versa. In fact, try reading “holy” nine times in a row out loud—it starts to get uncomfortable! Since in the context the living ones are repeating themselves endlessly, the ‘nine’ is both appropriate and effective. Three ‘holies’ for each member of the Trinity.","5069534808862954":"‘O Lord’ as in KJV is found in a very few late manuscripts.

Many modern versions follow that lone manuscript and omit the pronoun, but that leaves the transitive verb “redeem” without a direct object, so they usually supply “men” or some such thing.

People were saved in the OT without the indwelling Holy Spirit, and they will be too. But they will have to face the Beast and most of them will be martyred.

I take it that the Lord did not send them to the Abyss at that point because He had not won the victory yet—Satan was still the god of this world and the demons were doing their thing under Satan’s authority. But now we are to act on the basis of that victory, on the basis of our position and authority in Christ (Ephesians 2:6). So how did all those demons get into the Abyss to be available for the fifth trumpet? They got there because we sent them there!

So many copyists altered the text, reinforcing the prohibition. However, I take it that the voice was giving two unrelated instructions: not to record the thunders; and to put his notebook aside until later—he is going to be busy interacting with the angel and eating a book, and the voice does not want him to be distracted by trying to write at the same time.","7629523135256022":"“The days”—the events associated with a given trumpet (and probably seal and bowl) cover a period of time; they are not instantaneous.","904137521982193":"The action in verses 9-11 is presumably symbolic, but of what?

Of course a winepress has a single outlet and the liquid is conveyed to the receptacle by a conduit of appropriate size. In this case the conduit is 180 miles long and the flow is about four feet (1.33 yards) deep—four billion gallons equals about 20 million cubic yards; 180 miles equals about 320 thousand linear yards; so we have about 62.5 cubic yards of blood per linear yard of conduit—so the conduit is about 45 yards wide.

On the other hand, there are at least three heavens, 2 Corinthians 12:2, and they may have come out of the third, into the second.

But in order to be the Boss at both the beginning and the end, you have to be the greatest, and survive all challenges. All human history has been involved in Satan’s challenge of that supremacy. Because of that challenge, and because only at this point has that challenge been definitively put down, Jehovah the Son says, “I have become”.","7743545218836516":"Does it surprise you that “cowardly” is in this list? In Matthew 10:32-33 we read: “Everyone who will confess me before men, I will also confess him before my father who is in the heavens. But whoever should deny me before men, I will also deny him before my Father who is in the heavens.” See also Luke 12:8-9 and 1 John 2:23.

Anyone who caves in under pressure and disowns the Lord is out.","7591932204086334":"Both the TR and the so-called critical text omit “and sinners”, so most versions do as well, but two of the three main independent lines of transmission (including the best one) have the phrase.","33285509468987584":"That is what the Text says; instead of the noun ‘liar’ we find the adjective “false” (all the preceding descriptions are nouns, with one participle = “abominable”).","31345376023091376":"Actually the Text has “and”—John saw the visions in this order, but they will not necessarily happen in this order. I imagine that the New Jerusalem belongs to the Millennium (for reasons I will give below).","5237611846532673":"It seems to me to be unarguable that both Israel (the gates) and the Church (the foundations) participate in the New Jerusalem. (In fact, I imagine that the redeemed of all ages, up to the beginning of the Millennium, will be involved.) The rendering, “the woman [or, wife], the Lamb’s bride”, is based on over half of the Greek manuscripts, two of the three main independent lines of transmission (including the best one). In Jeremiah 3:20 and Hosea 2 Israel is presented as the wife of Jehovah—but in the O.T. wherever God interacts directly with the human race it is always Jehovah the Son. Passages like Matthew 25:10, John 3:29, 2 Corinthians 11:2 and Ephesians 5:25-27, 31-32 point to the Church as the bride of Christ (who is Jehovah the Son). So here the two come together—the wife, the bride—but maintain a distinct identity (gates are one thing and foundations are another)—indeed, nowhere does the Bible ever confuse Israel and the Church (not even in Galatians 6:16, as I can demonstrate to anyone who wishes to pursue the matter). But if the Church is still a “bride”, then the wedding has not happened yet, which is my first reason for placing this scene at the beginning of the Millennium.","4417966837063432":"I wonder, who replaces the Iscariot? Besides the Twelve, the only one who was personally chosen by Jesus was Saul of Tarsus.","576676235999912":"The evidence is badly divided here, but I take it that two of the three main independent lines of transmission (including the best one), do not add “and her wall”, which is read by most versions since both the TR and the so-called critical text so read. Two thousand years ago a city wall was a barrier to protect the city from attack, but the following context here makes clear that the wall was part of the structure. The city is a cube, like a modern high-rise, which is a recent concept in architecture. Many early copyists presumably assumed that the wall was distinct from the city and officiously altered the text. The angel measured precisely the city and her gates; see the next note.","5792748359963298":"Over half of the Greek manuscripts, two of the three main independent lines of transmission (including the best one), read “and twelve”—a surprising bit of precise detail. But consider—12,000 stadia, twelve gates—if the gates are evenly spaced, as seems likely, we have a thousand stadia between gates; or is it 1,001 stadia? I will argue below that each gate was one stadium wide, which nicely explains the precise number, twelve thousand and twelve!","38609502860344946":"The city is a cube, the total measurement being about 1,350 miles! But does it mean the circumference or is it referring to the three dimensions? If it refers to the circumference we divide by four and each side is about 340 miles long, and of course the height is also 340 miles. If we divide by three each dimension is about 450 miles. In either event, we have one incredibly large city! But because of the twelve gates and 12,000 stadia I really believe that the angel measured the circumference.","4186822746414691":"That is about 70 yards; since we already know that the wall is hundreds of miles high, the reference here must be to the thickness of the wall. I take it that the wall was part of the structure, like in a modern high-rise, not like a fence (with no enemies there is no need for a fence—in fact, verse 25 makes clear that even the gates will never be closed).","7381262995768338":"This is curious; apparently angels use the same measurement as humans. But then, with reference to things on this earth, why wouldn’t they?","29984260303899646":"See verse 11 above.","23181547853164375":"Each foundation was adorned with a different kind of stone. But how were the twelve foundations arranged, piled up or side by side? Presumably the gates were evenly spaced, with 1,000 stadia between each pair, so perhaps each such space represented an Apostle and had a different precious stone.","6442669236566871":"Are not doors and gates usually wider than the wall is thick? The wall here is some 70 yards thick. I propose that each pearl was 200 yards (one stadium) wide (some pearl!), but notice in verse 25 that the gates were never closed, which means that they always remained in one position, hence no wear and tear on the ‘hinges’. But imagine that we are on that tremendously high mountain with John, and that we are perpendicular to the middle of one wall and at a distance of 50 miles. We are looking at a monstrous wall 340 miles square; it merely fills the horizon. At the base of the wall, evenly spaced (some 110 miles between them), are three gates. Would a gate 200 yards wide be out of proportion? Given the size of the wall, such gates might even seem small!","010119325714185834":"The ‘gold’ here is evidently different from the gold we know; John does not say that it looked like gold, he says it was gold.","5791413590777665":"“Kings of the earth”—we are still on the earth, with kings and nations coming and going, which is my second reason for placing the New Jerusalem during the Millennium.","7541849594563246":"That is, defiled or profane; perhaps anything not consecrated to God.","04110291809774935":"Connecting this statement with 22:15, we have all sorts of nasty people outside the city. After the Millennium and the Great White Throne they will be in the Lake of fire, so if they are still circulating on this earth, it must be during the Millennium, which is my third reason. Because of 22:15 I am inclined to suppose that the New Jerusalem will rest on the earth (not be a satellite, as some argue). But if so, where? The desert east of Jordan is hundreds of miles square with very few inhabitants, and relatively plane, yet quite close to the present Jerusalem. Perhaps there.","09480133838951588":"So why else did you think there was an angel stationed at each gate (21:12)?","0316995307803154":"This river should not be confused with the one in Ezekiel 47. The present city of Jerusalem will still exist and function during the Millennium. The two rivers share certain characteristics, but are also quite different. Zechariah 14:8 may well have to do with Ezekiel 47.","4419533561449498":"Two of the three main independent lines of transmission (including the best one) have “of the spirits”.

In Deuteronomy 23:18 ‘dog’ apparently refers to a male prostitute, a catamite, and is declared to be an abomination. In O.T. times dogs were scavengers and therefore unclean, and were generally looked down upon. In Jesus’ day Jews referred to Gentiles as ‘dogs’, but since many Gentiles are in the Church that is presumably not the intended meaning here. The ‘dogs’ in Matthew 7:6 react in an aggressively hostile manner against what is holy; I take it that they are people who are overtly serving evil (Philippians 3:2 may be referring to this sort of person). So who are the ‘dogs’ here? At the very least they are the unclean. Take it from there.","62073830422014":"Relativism is an idol; Humanism is an idol; Materialism is an idol.
